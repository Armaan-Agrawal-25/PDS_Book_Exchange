**Princeton Day School Online Book Exchange App:** Designed and developed a Flask web application that allows Princeton Day School students to sell books to other students as well as purchase books they need for their own coursework. Users can browse listings made by other students and search for specific books based on the title, the course they are used for, or the price range. They can then utilize the included contact information to get in touch with the owner of the book they want and proceed from there. Additionally, users can list their own books for sale onto the website. This was created in an effort to help people save money on books and make sure that old books are reused instead of being thrown out.

Details:
- Wrote a Python application utilizing the Flask framework that allows a user to browse and upload book listings.
- Utilized the Pandas library to handle displaying the listings and filtering of said data based on user requests.
- Wrote HTML code to specify the look and design of the application.
